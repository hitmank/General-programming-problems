# 1. Two Sum Problem
    Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

    Example:
    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [0, 1].
    
# 2. Multiply Strings
    Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2.
    
    Note:
    
    The length of both num1 and num2 is < 110.
    Both num1 and num2 contains only digits 0-9.
    Both num1 and num2 does not contain any leading zero.
    You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
    
# 3. Linked List Addition
    You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

    You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

    Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
    Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
    
# 4. Longest Substring without duplicates
    Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

    Examples:

    Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

    Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

    Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a    subsequence and not a substring.

# 5. Moving Zero's to the End of an Array (Inplace and extra array)
    Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

    For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].

    Note:
    You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
    Minimize the total number of operations.
